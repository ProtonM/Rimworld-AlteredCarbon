Welcome any and all of you to Rimworld: Altered Carbon!

“In the far future, on some Ultratech worlds, the death of one's biological body no longer means the end. Due to implants called “Cortical Stacks” ones consciousness is no longer stored in the brain, but on the implant. If your body dies, you can simply extract the stack and install it in a new body. Extending your life for as long as your stack is intact.
But on Rimworld's, this tech is rare, but it still can be found from time to time!”

With this mod we bring the concept of Stacks and Sleeves from the popular Netflix show and book series by Richard K. Morgan to Rimworld.
Find and install implants into your colonists to prevent their death when their bodies die, grow high quality, custom bodies for your colonists, enjoy amazing new weapons and the beautiful Protectorate Armour. All implemented without contradicting Vanilla Rimworld Lore, vanilla friendly and with textures made by Oskar Potocki.
